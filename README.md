Enseble SVMs for multiclass classification, implemented with the Pegasos algorithm. Learning done in parallel using CUDA and MPI.

Two reports are included, MLReport focuses on the validity of the Machine Learning problem and accuracy of the classifier whereas ParallelReport focusses on the parallelization problem and how best to approach this.
